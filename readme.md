# bevy-explorer

A forward-looking implementation of the Decentraland protocol.

This implementation uses [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) engine, and targets desktop clients.

This project's goals are to:
- document current and future protocol standards
- experiment with changes to the protocol
- increase the field of alternative Explorers
- prioritize solid fundamentals, extensibility, and the use of modern open-source frameworks
